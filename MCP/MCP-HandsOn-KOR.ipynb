Such tests help doctors diagnose the disease in people with cognitive symptoms, but do not indicate the clinical stage of the disease symptoms—that is, the degree of impairment in thinking or memory due to Alzheimer's dementia.\\nCurrent Alzheimer's therapies are most effective in the early stages of the disease, so having a relatively easy and reliable way to gauge how far the disease has progressed could help doctors determine which patients are likely to benefit from drug treatment and to what extent. The new test can also provide insight into whether a person's symptoms are likely due to Alzheimer's versus some other cause.\\nThe study is published in Nature Medicine.\\nIn the study, the researchers found that levels of a protein called MTBR-tau243 in the blood accurately reflect the amount of toxic accumulation of tau aggregates in the brain and correlate with the severity of Alzheimer's disease.\\nAnalyzing blood levels of MTBR-tau243 from a group of people with cognitive decline, the researchers were able to distinguish between people with early- or later-stage Alzheimer's disease and separate both groups of Alzheimer's patients from people whose symptoms were caused by something other than Alzheimer's disease.\\n\\\"This blood test clearly identifies Alzheimer's tau tangles, which is our best biomarker measure of Alzheimer's symptoms and dementia,\\\" said co-senior author Randall J. Bateman, MD, the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine.\\n\\\"In clinical practice right now, we don't have easy or accessible measures of Alzheimer's tangles and dementia, and so a tangle blood test like this can provide a much better indication if the symptoms are due to Alzheimer's and may also help doctors decide which treatments are best for their patients.\\\"\\nTracking Alzheimer's disease progression from blood\\nAlzheimer's disease involves a buildup of a protein, called amyloid, into plaques in the brain, followed by the development of tangles of tau protein years later. Cognitive symptoms emerge around the time tau tangles become detectable, and symptoms worsen as the tangles spread.\\nThe gold standard for staging Alzheimer's disease is positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans for amyloid plaques and tau tangles. Amyloid scans yield information about the presymptomatic and early symptomatic stages, while tau scans are useful for tracking later stages of the disease.\\nPET brain scans are highly accurate but expensive, time-consuming and frequently unavailable outside of major research centers, so they are not widely used.\\nBateman leads a team that is developing blood tests for Alzheimer's disease as a more accessible alternative to brain scans. They have developed two blood tests that correlate closely with the amount of amyloid plaques in the brain. Both are now used by doctors to aid diagnosis. But until now, there has been no blood test that reports on tau levels in the brain.\\nIn a previous study, Bateman and colleagues—including co-first authors Kanta Horie, Ph.D., a research associate professor of neurology at WashU Medicine, and Gemma Salvadó, Ph.D., then a postdoctoral researcher at Lund University, and co-senior author Oskar Hansson, MD, Ph.D., a professor of neurology at Lund University—showed that cerebrospinal fluid levels of MTBR-tau243 correlate closely with tau tangles in the brain.\\nIn the current study, the team extended the analysis to blood. A blood sample is easier to collect than cerebrospinal fluid, which is obtained via spinal tap.\\nThe researchers developed a technique to measure MTBR-tau243 levels in people's blood and compared it to the amount of tau tangles in their brains as measured by brain scans.\\nThey piloted the approach on data from two cohorts: volunteers at WashU Medicine's Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center, which included 108 people, and a subset of 55 people from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort.\\nTo assess whether the approach was generalizable, they validated it in an independent dataset consisting of the remaining 739 people in the BioFINDER-2 cohort.\\nThe people in the two cohorts represented all but the most severe end of the spectrum of Alzheimer's disease, from the presymptomatic stage when brain amyloid levels are elevated but people remain cognitively healthy, through early-stage disease with mild cognitive impairments, to late symptomatic disease when patients exhibit full-blown dementia.\\nFor comparison, cognitively healthy people with normal amyloid levels, and people with cognitive symptoms due to conditions other than Alzheimer's disease, were included.\\nThe researchers' analysis showed that blood MTBR-tau243 levels reflected the amount of tau tangles in the brain with 92% accuracy. MTBR-tau243 levels in the blood were normal in asymptomatic people regardless of amyloid status, meaning that blood MTBR-tau243 levels do not change between healthy people and people in the presymptomatic stage of Alzheimer's disease with amyloid plaques.\\nAmong people with cognitive symptoms due to Alzheimer's disease, MTBR-tau243 levels were significantly elevated for people in the mild cognitive impairment phase of Alzheimer's disease and much higher—up to 200 times—for those in the dementia phase. Those differences translated into clear separation of people with early- and late-stage Alzheimer's disease.\\nAt the same time, MTBR-tau243 levels were normal in people with cognitive symptoms due to diseases other than Alzheimer's, meaning that the test effectively distinguished Alzheimer's dementia from other kinds of dementia.\\nThe technology underlying the blood test for tau aggregates has been licensed by WashU to C2N Diagnostics, a WashU startup that developed the blood tests for amyloid. These amyloid tests incorporate measures of another form of tau called p-tau217.\\n\\\"I believe we will use blood-based p-tau217 to determine whether an individual has Alzheimer's disease, but MTBR-tau243 will be a highly valuable complement in both clinical settings and research trials,\\\" said Hansson.\\n\\\"When both of these biomarkers are positive, the likelihood that Alzheimer's is the underlying cause of a person's cognitive symptoms increases significantly, compared to when only p-tau217 is abnormal. This distinction is crucial for selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient.\\\"\\nBlood tests could inform personalized Alzheimer's treatment\\nTwo Alzheimer's therapies have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to slow progression of the disease, and both work by lowering amyloid levels in the brain.\\nHorie said the number and variety of available Alzheimer's medications may soon be expanding, as several experimental drugs that target tau or other aspects of Alzheimer's disease are in the pipeline. With blood tests to diagnose and stage the disease, doctors would be able to tailor treatments to the patient's particular disease state.\\n\\\"We're about to enter the era of personalized medicine for Alzheimer's disease,\\\" Horie said.\\n\\\"For early stages with low tau tangles, anti-amyloid therapies could be more efficacious than in late stages. But after the onset of dementia with high tau tangles, anti-tau therapy or one of the many other experimental approaches may be more effective.\\n\\\"Once we have a clinically available blood test for staging, plus treatments that work at different stages of the disease, doctors will be able to optimize their treatment plans for the specific needs of each patient.\\\"\\nMore information: Kanta Horie et al, Plasma MTBR-tau243 biomarker identifies tau tangle pathology in Alzheimer's disease, Nature Medicine (2025).

The embassy didn’t respond to questions this weekend from The Associated Press.\\nLe Figaro daily newspaper published what it said was a copy of the letter. The document said that an executive order that Trump signed in January terminating DEI programs within the federal government also “applies to all suppliers and service providers of the U.S. Government, regardless of their nationality and the country in which they operate.”\\nThe document asked recipients to complete, sign and return within five days a separate certification form to demonstrate that they are in compliance.\\nThat form, also published by Le Figaro, said: “All Department of State contractors must certify that they do not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable anti-discrimination laws.”\\nRelated Stories\\nMacron's message to Trump: 'You can’t be weak in the face of Putin'\\nFrom France comes a call for Trump's America to return Lady Liberty.

That’s to say it’s an attempt to impose a diktat on our businesses.”\\nSpeaking to broadcaster BFMTV, she said that France’s government is “following the situation very closely” and working to determine how many companies received the letter.\\nThe minister said that “many” companies have told the government that they don’t plan to reply, “because they don’t have a respond, in fact, to a sort of ultimatum laid out by the U.S. Embassy in our country.”\\n“It’s out of the question that we’ll prevent our business from promoting social progress,” the minister said. “Thankfully, a lot of French companies don’t plan to change their rules.”\\nGeorgia Senate approves investigation of Democrat Stacey Abrams as Trump targets herGeorgia’s Republican-dominated state Senate is moving ahead with an investigation of Stacey Abrams.

Coyote.\\nAfter being shelved by Warner Bros. in 2023, the Looney Tunes film “Coyote vs. Acme” has found a new home. Ketchup Entertainment announced Monday that it acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film for an undisclosed sum.\\nThe deal gives new life to one of the three fully completed films that Warner Bros. elected to take a tax write-off on rather than release. The tactic, which followed a change in leadership at Warner Bros. coming out of the pandemic, was widely disparaged by creatives and fans, alike. The other two shelved movies — the $90 million DC Studios production “Batgirl” and the animated “Scoob! Holiday Haunt” — remain unreleased.\\nBut “Coyote vs. Acme” will be salvaged from the dustbin. Ketchup Entertainment plans a theatrical release at an unspecified future date.\\n“We’re thrilled to have made a deal with Warner Bros. Pictures to bring this film to audiences worldwide,” Gareth West, chief executive of Ketchup Entertainment, said in a statement. “‘Coyote vs Acme’ is a perfect blend of nostalgia and modern storytelling, capturing the essence of the beloved Looney Tunes characters while introducing them to a new generation.”\\nRelated Stories\\n‘Novocaine’ leads numbingly slow weekend at domestic box office\\nAhead of the 2025 Oscars, AP hands out its own awards\\n'Snow White' opens with $43 million at box office\\nDirected by Dave Green and based on a New Yorker article by Ian Frazier, “Coyote vs. Acme” follows Wile E. Coyote in a lawsuit against Acme Corporation for the many faulty products that failed to catch him the Road Runner. The live-action animated hybrid stars John Cena and Will Forte.\\nDeadline earlier reported that Ketchup paid about $50 million for the film, which cost $70 million to produce. Ketchup, a distribution company launched in 2012, also recently released another Looney Tunes film jettisoned by Warner Bros.: “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.” In three weeks of release, it’s grossed $8.2 million in domestic ticket sales.\\nJAKE COYLE\\nCoyle has been a film critic and covered the movie industry for The Associated Press since 2013.

      "\n",
      "### 2.2 온디바이스 AI 기술\n",
      "\n",
      "삼성 가우스의 가장 중요한 특징 중 하나는 '온디바이스' 작동을 지원한다는 점입니다. 이는 기기 내에서 AI 모델이 작동할 수 있다는 의미로, 외부 서버에 데이터를 전송하지 않고도 AI 기능을 사용할 수 있게 해줍니다. 이러한 특성은 다음과 같은 장점을 제공합니다:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 사용자 정보가 외부로 유출될 위험이 없음\n",
      "- 인터넷 연결 없이도 AI 기능 사용 가능\n",
      "- 데이터 처리 지연 시간(latency) 감소\n",
      "- 개인정보 보호 강화\n",
      "\n",

      "삼성전자는 '삼성 개발자 콘퍼런스 코리아 2023'에서도 삼성 가우스를 활용한 온디바이스 AI 기술을 소개했습니다. 이는 개발자들이 삼성의 AI 기술을 활용할 수 있도록 생태계를 구축하려는 노력의 일환으로 볼 수 있습니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. 시장 포지셔닝 및 경쟁 환경\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.1 경쟁 구도\n",
      "\n",
      "현재 생성형 AI 시장은 OpenAI의 ChatGPT, Google의 Bard, Meta의 Llama 등 다양한 기업들이 경쟁하고 있습니다. 2024년부터 가우스를 탑재한 삼성 스마트폰은 메타의 라마(Llama)2를 탑재한 퀄컴 기기 및 구글 어시스턴트를 적용한 구글 픽셀(Pixel)과 경쟁할 것으로 예상됩니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 차별화 전략\n",
      "\n",
      "삼성전자는 이러한 경쟁 환경에서 '온디바이스' AI라는 차별화된 접근법을 취하고 있습니다. 테크리퍼블릭에 따르면 온디바이스 AI는 주요 기술 트렌드로 부상하고 있으며, 특히 프라이버시 보호에 대한 소비자 관심이 높아지는 상황에서 중요한 경쟁 우위가 될 수 있습니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. 결론 및 전망\n",
      "\n",
      "삼성 가우스는 삼성전자가 글로벌 AI 경쟁에서 자체 기술력을 확보하기 위한 중요한 전략적 움직임입니다. 온디바이스 AI 기술을 강조함으로써 프라이버시 보호라는 차별화된 가치를 제공하고, 언어, 코드, 이미지의 세 가지 모델을 통합적으로 개발한 점은 다양한 사용자 요구를 충족시킬 수 있는 종합적인 AI 솔루션을 목표로 하고 있음을 보여줍니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "향후 삼성 가우스가 삼성전자의 다양한 제품에 탑재되면서, 사용자들은 더욱 개인화되고 프라이버시가 보호되는 AI 경험을 누릴 수 있을 것으로 기대됩니다. 또한 이는 모바일 및 가전 시장에서 삼성전자의 경쟁력을 강화하는 중요한 요소가 될 것입니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "결론적으로, 삼성 가우스는 삼성전자가 AI 기술 경쟁에서 주도권을 확보하고, 자사의 다양한 제품 라인업에 AI 기능을 통합하여 차별화된 사용자 경험을 제공하기 위한 중요한 전략적 자산이라고 할 수 있습니다."
